# _ebPalettes

Collection of palettes in `.hexplt` format, which is a list of RGB colors in hex format, one per line, like this:

```
#002147
#003153
#333366
#32127a
#79443b
#a45a52
```

I invented this format (I think, but I wouldn't be surprised if others have done the same) for scripting to make art with lists of colors.

## Markdown galleries

Navigate the folders on GitHub to see previews of palettes (rendered as .png images) via `README.md` files in each folder, like this:

### [palettes/RAHfavoriteColorsHex](palettes/RAHfavoriteColorsHex.hexplt)

[ ![palettes/RAHfavoriteColorsHex.png](palettes/RAHfavoriteColorsHex.png) ](palettes/RAHfavoriteColorsHex.png)

-- where the title over the image links to the source `.hexplt` file, and the rendered image links to the image file.

## Scripts that render palettes and galleries

Some scripts I have developed that created the palette renders and markdown galleries in this repository are [renderAllHexPalettes-gm.sh]( https://github.com/earthbound19/_ebDev/blob/master/scripts/imgAndVideo/renderAllHexPalettes-gm.sh) and [palettesMarkdownGalleries.sh](https://github.com/earthbound19/_ebDev/blob/master/scripts/imgAndVideo/palettesMarkdownGalleries.sh).

## Sources of Maths

Palettes in this collection are generated randomly and/or made by me, or may be collected from elsewhere.

Where they are collected from elsewhere, I'm careful to avoid intellectual property concerns by referring only to public domain information (such as sources or times), without using any copyrightable or trademarkeable etc. information. The public domain information I use includes the math of what numbers are concerned with what palettes. You can't exert intellectual property control on numbers.
